This is a visual representation of the 1916 Doris meyer Diary, an attempt to visualize and geomap the locations mentioned in the diary onto a representation of modern Dublin. This will be useful for educational purposes as it will help a prospective student to understand the setting of the diary in the context of the way the city appears today.

##Earl Street![Earl Street] (http://dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content//RecreationandCulture/DecadeofCommemorations/DecadeofCommemorations/PublishingImages/Sml_Lrg_Images/SDI_020_North_Earl_Street.jpg)
Doris, accompanied by her friend Ms Austin, travels from Derry and passes through Portadown on her way. She arrives as Amiens St., now known as Connolly Station, and runs into difficulties in terms of transport--the discourse in the city means that there are no taxis available. A porter informs them “that no taxi man would risk his life to come out.” Doris and her party have to travel down the Quays due to Earl Street being blocked off “with broken glass everywhere.” Eventually reaching the home she is staying in, she describes how the “Sinn Feiners” have taken over the GPO. Her brother Alan wants to go and fight but is forbidden to by their parents.

Doris attempts to go to work in the Bank of Ireland at Harcourt St. . Upon reaching the Ivanhoe Hotel she was advised to return home as there was heavy fighting between the Sinn feiners and the military nearby and the bank was closed. Both she and Alan was surprised by the amount of people in Rathmines and at Portobello Bridge who were standing in the streets watching all the commotion.

Again Doris was sent home from work. With Marshal law being declared food stores began to run low so Doris and her father walk to Findlater's market for supplies. They encountered sentries and were unable to return to Rathmines so they stopped at a friends house at Charleville Road. The uncertainty of safely moving through the city was very exciting for Doris.

##Queues for food in the days after the Easter Rising![Queues for food in the days after the Easter Rising](http://thecricketbatthatdiedforireland.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_7552.gif)
No one tried to get to work and tried to find food instead. There were large queues outside all of the local shops as people rushed to get supplies. Sentries were posted throughout the city, guarding various buildings. A curfew was enforced, people had to be off the streets from 7:30 pm to 5:30 am. The fighting is becoming common and the family have become familiar with the sounds of the different weapons as they "have all become quite war-worn veterans."

## Portobello Barracks![Portobello Barracks](http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/exhibition/dublin/law_order/full/J_Portobello_Barracks_NA06-056.jpg)
Food is still in short supply and bread is running low, so Doris's mother has to bake some for the family. There has been no newspapers and no one is sure of what is happening, people are beginning to say that "the other war might be over for all we know!" *(World War I)*. Security is being heightened and there are now sentries posted through the Rathmines area but the locals find the whole experience entertaining.

##English newspaper covering the Easter Rising![English newspaper concerning the Easter Rising](http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/620/2014/1916_outside.jpg)
Bread is becoming hard to come by, but Doris's uncle manages to supply the family with some. Doris and Alan walk to Ranelagh where they hear that "two women had been shot..." Rumours began to pass that the fighting was over, but everyone was hesitant to believe them. Newspapers from England arrived, allowing people to learn what was happening across the city and the country.

##Charsleton Street Methodist Church![Charsleton Street Methodist Church](http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/198854.jpg)
The family attend church as normal. Their local church, Charleston Road Methodist Church, is more crowded than usual as the St. Stephens Green church is inaccessible. While in church, the military sent everyone home as shooting in the area becomes too intense.

##Johnston and Mooneys Bakery at Ballsbridge![Johnston and Mooneys Bakery at Ballsbridge](http://dublincitypubliclibraries.com/image/view/955/_original)
Alan and Doris make their way to the Johnston and Mooney bakery in Ballsbridge to get bread. Crowds of people have been queuing for hours hoping to be served, some having arrived at 6am. When they begin to walk home, they encounter streams of people with "loaves tucked under their arm". Sights like this are now common. The streets are now cleared by 8:30pm and "all the houses are dark" as people shelter at the back of their homes.

Doris is awakened by "soldiers marching up the street". She sees that they take two prisoners from a house across the road and search many others. Later that day both she and her father venture into the town to "see the sights". The bridges are still guarded by sentries and people "have to have a pass" to get through. The scenes are "simply awful" and Doris is amazed to see that most of Sackville St. *(Now O'Connell St.)* is left in ruins.
